Prevalidation Steps:
========================
1.VIOS installed with required build,& SEA cofiguration.(ipv6 will configured)
2.Disks should shared.()
3.each client---40Gb rootvg+40GB datavg(80GB)
                caavg----7gb(2 disk)
                mirroring----Double the size+50Gb extra
  
NOTE-:Requirement should be metinaied by user


Cluster tool
=================
1.provoide eall disk info from DBN node(script will verify if it's share dor not)
2.Check no-reserve polict & activate pvid.
3.Tire will based on nodes(based on cec)
4.LU mapping taken care based on tiers.
5.Thick,thinn LU based on users requirement(else -random).
6.Mirroring not implemented now--phase2
7.ipv6 not considered yet.




ERORR Handling
================
Currently populating the msg directly as reported by the script
We will mentain separate packege



LOG mentainance
==================
1.same location as lpar cretion tool----logger/dumps/cluster regression --folder need to create---keep a file with clustername_date format
  
2.


============================================
7----CT tool install client.


Workload
==============
HTX,BLast,auto regression


SSP tool













changes:
============
1.disks should be in terms of range ex---hdisk0-hdisk27.
2.tier,lu  should be , or ; separated
